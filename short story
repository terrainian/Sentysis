The weather was nasty. Every cloud had a snear to it, a chewed smile contorted every shadow cast by a bitterly bright sun. 
As if the rain had come from tarred lakes, the puddles we ran through exploded with the scent of gasoline.
It would be another three weeks until my new hand grew to its full size. I'd avoid this foul weather from now on, 
keep only to covered walkways and try to drive only if absolutely necessary. There was something disorienting 
accompanying the sensation of my hand growing from the stump I'd become so used to...
